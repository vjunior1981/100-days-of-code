# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Vitor Jr

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 20220306.

## Log

### R1D0 - 20220306
**Today's Progress**: Defined what language I should learn that I could take more advantage: `golang`.

**Thoughts** [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) has amazing trainings for Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, etc... with A LOT OF PRACTICE. And now they also have a [golang training](https://www.udemy.com/course/golang-for-beginners/).

**Link(s) to work**
1. I don't have a work... yet! Cause I'm planning what I'm going to start tomorrow, so... stay with Gopher!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
